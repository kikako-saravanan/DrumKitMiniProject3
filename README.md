# DrumKitMiniProject3
This is a miniproject to practise HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript concepts.This project contains various drums images and sound.whenever drum is pressed(click and keypress), the corresponding sound will be played.
For this project, I used event listener concept, high order function, callbacks and setTimeout for animation.
